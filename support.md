## Direct support

### Via stars

If you want to directly support us, we would be very happy if you could star [our projects](https://github.com/goatcorp/) on GitHub. This is free, but helps our contributors regardless.

### Donations

Individual developers often have their own donation links - these are typically linked within their plugins or on their GitHub profiles. Feel free to browse around - every one of them will appreciate your support. If you can't find a way to donate, the developer likely does not take direct donations.
