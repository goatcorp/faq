* Don't assume that users are at all familiar with FFXIV plugins/mods and our ecosystem/third-party plugin situation other than watching a quick showcase video
* If you don't think you're in a mindset to provide support without getting snippy, take a break & get some orange juice - we don't want this work to take a toll on your mental health and we would like everyone to have a good experience
* Please be polite and respectful, don't be too terse
  => Please don't make people feel like they are being rushed out the door
* Do NOT dogpile users - if you see that someone else is typing to respond, or if someone else is already helping the user, please don't send your message and let them help instead
  => If you may have info that your peer doesn't have, feel free to intersect anyway, of course - respectfully
* It's fine to not be able to help everyone at the same time. People don't tend to expect immediate support from a volunteer project, and you can always point them to the "how-to-get-help" channel first.
* This might sound cheesy, but remember that there's a person on the other side

These rules apply to members with support roles, but also to other members that just want to help out.

Regarding third-party plugins:
* Please politely point users to our reworked rules in #welcome.
* As an exception to the rules, feel free to link users to Penumbra's discord server if they ask about support for it.
